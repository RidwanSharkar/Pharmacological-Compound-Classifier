# Neurochemical Compound Classifier
- Predictive Modeling of Chemical Compounds' Drug Classifications
- Using Machine Learning to identify Structure-Activity-Relationships (QSAR)

## Overview: 

• This project employs an ensemble of machine learning models to examine pharmacological properties by emulating Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) of chemical compounds based on their extensive molecular properties. 

• Users can search and sort the database for pharmacological classifications & compounds - Compounds that DO NOT have any classification data available on PubChem will predicted by the model, if possible.

## Methods 1: Data Scraping & Random Forest

• Inspired by this dataset of 635 psychoactive compounds and their 117 molecular properties. 
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/psychedelic-drug-database?resource=download], 
a webscraper is set up to retrieve data from all compounds listed under PubChem.ncbi that possess a known 'MeSH Pharmacological Classification' (totaling 17,866 entries) to create and store a more expansive dataset.

• RD-Kit (Cheminformatics) is then used to retrieve and compute all scraped compounds' molecular popularties, which have been expanded to include 244 molecular porperties - now including counts of all functional groups (amides, halogens, ketones, etc.) as well as electrotopological states (E-state) information that directly correlate molecular behavior with biological receptor activity.

• All scraped and computed data is then fed to a Random Forest machine learning model to determine which molecular properties correlate highest with the compounds' pharmacological action. These weighed attributes are then used by the model to predict the pharmacological classification of a novel compound whose official 'MeSH Pharmacological Classification' is NOT listed on PubChem. 


### Example 'MeSH Pharmacological Classification':

• [Anti-Psychotic Agents, Serotonin Receptor Agonists, Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors, Protein Kinase Inhibitors, Vasoconstrictor Agents, etc.]

• Hamming Loss - Multi-Label Classification - is utilized to allow independent prediction of each activity within the set of pharmacological activities:

## Methods 2: Deep Learning

([https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01422](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01422)) <br>

Feature Selection from Random Forest model is used to guide setup of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with the following parameters to achieve highest validation accuracy and AUC (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5297997/):


• Normalization of Molecular Properties using StandardScalar() (scaling to unit variance) 

• 1st Layer: 1760 Neuron Count

• 2nd Layer: 1240 Neuron Count

• 3rd Layer: 512 Neuron Count

• Output layer: Sigmoid Activation (for independent label predictions)  |  Dropout Layers: 0.25-0.4 

• Batch Size: 64  |  Epochs: 120

• Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy (to be compatible with Multi-Label-Classification setup)

• Learning Rate: 0.00035 with Adam Optimizer 

• Gradient Clipping & Early Stopping 

• BatchNormalization() & L2 Regularizers*
